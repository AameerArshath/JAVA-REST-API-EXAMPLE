Development Environment Setup: Ensure you have Java, an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse), Maven, and MongoDB installed and running.

Create a Maven Project: Start a new Maven project in your IDE and configure it with a group ID, artifact ID, and package name.

Add Dependencies: In your project's pom.xml, include dependencies for Spring Boot (for building REST APIs) and MongoDB (for database integration).

Create a Server Entity: Define a Java class that represents the "server" object. Annotate it as a Spring Data MongoDB document to enable database mapping.

Create a Server Repository: Develop a repository interface that extends MongoRepository to handle database operations on server objects.

Create a REST Controller: Implement a REST controller class with methods for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and any additional endpoints. Inject the repository for database interaction.

Configure MongoDB: In your application.properties or application.yml file, configure the MongoDB connection properties.

Run the Application: Run your Spring Boot application. Ensure MongoDB is up and running.

Test with Postman or CURL: Use tools like Postman or CURL to test your REST API by sending HTTP requests to the defined endpoints for server management.
